# Welcome to Select20 contributing guide

Thank you for your time in contributing to our Select20! Any contribution you make will the software better.


This guide gives you an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## Getting started

### Create a new issue

If you spot a bug / error in the software, search if an issue already exists. If a related issue does not exist, you can open a new issue.

### Solve an issue

Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using labels as filters. See Labels for more information. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with the changes. Do not forget to self-review to speed up the review process.

## Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request (PR).

- Do not forget to link PR to issue if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to allow maintainer edits so the branch can be updated for a merge. Once you submit your PR, we will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using suggested changes or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.

Now your PR is merged!
